  "wishText": "To the one who stole my heart bas \"ek jhak maar ke \", bas made this because since the day you have \"come thru\" in my life, aisa lag hai \"bin tere\" mai mar hi jata. subah uth te hi tumhare FaceTime ate hi \"uff Teri ada\" pe mai fir sa jata hun. Fighting with you over cute and little stuff makes me think \"kya yeh hi pyaar hai\". Coz altho we fight sometimes, I am always ready to \"die for you\". \"pal pal har pal\" with you I think \"yeh ishq hai\" jo mujhe kuch bhi hojaye tum se kabhi door nahi Jane data. U were with me \"at my worst\" even when we had \"double takes\" about each other but you always made me realize \"tum hi ho bandhu\" jiske bina yeh \"Mann mera\" kahin bikhar sa jata. Kyunki \"Jab se Mila tu\", \"mera man kehna laga\" \" I love you\". So thank you my \"iktara\" for making me realize \"what falling in love feels like\""
